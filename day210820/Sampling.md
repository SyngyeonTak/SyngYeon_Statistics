## Sampling

### Outline

Sampling definitions

Simple Random Sampling

Stratified Sampling

Systematic Sampling

Convenience & Multi stage Sampling
</br></br>

### Sampling Frame

Sampling frame is the part of the population from which you want to draw a sample

Therefore, you want everyone from your sampling frame to have a chance of being selected for your sample 
</br></br>

### Undercoverage

Omitting population members from the sampling frame
</br></br>

### Errors in Statistics

Fact-of-Life Error(?)

Error that happens generally

Sampling error: The population mean will probably be different from your sample mean
</br>

Error you want to Avoid

Your mistakes

Non-sampling error:
</br></br>

### Simple random sampling

Being in a simple random sample means that the smaple has an equal chase chance of being selected out of the hat that this group of people that have an equal chance of being selected.

Even if you do simple random sampling, you need a good list
</br></br>

### Stratified Sampling

What is Stratified Sampling?

First, the list is divided into groups, or strata

This is a way to make it so that there are certain proportions of groups in the final sample

Steps in Stratified Sampling

Divide entire population into distinct subgroups called strata.

The strata are based on a specific characteristic, such as age, income, education level, and so on

All members of a stratum share this specific characteristic

Draw an SRS(Simple Random Sampling) from each stratum
</br></br>

### Systematic Sampling

Arrange all individuals of the population in a particular order

Pick a random individual as a start

Then take every kth(so many) member of the population in the sample
</br></br>

### Cluster Sampling

Cluster sampling is used when geography is important in sampling.

The map is divided into areas, and all the people in a particular area are sampled

Biased toward type of people living in the area

Cluster sampling is defined as a sampling method where the researcher creates multiple clusters of people from a population where they are indicative of homogeneous characteristics and have an equal chance of being a part of the sample.

**Example:** Consider a scenario where an organization is looking to survey the performance of smartphones across Germany. They can divide the entire country’s population into cities (clusters) and select further towns with the highest population and also filter those using mobile devices.
</br></br>

### Convenience & Multi-Stage Sampling

Using results or data that are conveniently or readily obtained

Can be useful if not a lot of resources allocated to the study

Use an already-assembled group for surveys

Ask patients in the waiting room to fill out a survey, or students in a class

What are the problems with convenience Sampling?
</br></br>

- There is a bias in every group

Multi-stage Sampling

Combination of sampling strategies layered in states

ex) Cluster sample if states- > Simple random sample of counties

→ Stratified sample of school(urban/rural) → stratified sample of classrooms
