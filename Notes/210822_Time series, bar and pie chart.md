## Time series, bar, and pie chart

## Time Series Graph

Time series data are made of measurements for the same variable for the same individual taken at intervals over a period of time

Stock market prices

Yearly rates of diseases such as influenza
<br>
### How to plot a Time-Series Graph

1. Get time series data: one measurement per time period (month, year, etc)
2. Draw a horizontal line for the x-axis. Label the time periods
3. Draw a vertical line for the y-axis. Make sure it is tall enough for the highest data value. Label it
4. Looking at your data, the x-axis, and the y-axis, put dots in where the data points are
5. Connect the dots
6. You can have more than one line on the graph for more than one set of data values, but this requires a legend

## Bar graph

Display Quantitative or Qualitative Data
<br>
### Features of a Bar Graph

1. Bar can be vertical or horizontal
2. Are of uniform width and of uniform spacing
3. Length of bars represent variable's frequency or percentage of occurrence
4. Same measurement scale used for each bar
5. Includes title, bar labels. and scale labels on axis or actual values for each bar.

### Warning About Changing the scale

See how the differences between bars are more dramatic when we change the scale to be shorter?

Now, let's go the other way.

Let's see what happens if we may the y-axis twice as high - with the maximum at 70.0

### Pareto Chart

The height of the bar indicates the frequency of an event

Arranged left to right according to decreasing height

Meant to graph frequencies of problems

Used more in engineering than in healthcare
<br>
## Pie chart

### Features of a Pie chart

Every individual must be put in only one category

Can be qualitative or quantitative variable

If quantitative, put in classes and then graphed
