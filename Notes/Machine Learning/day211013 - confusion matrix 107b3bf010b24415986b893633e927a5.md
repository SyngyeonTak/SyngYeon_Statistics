# day211013 - confusion matrix

Let's say we could use many methods for testing data.

Such as logistic, linear, random forest etc.

and we have to figure out which method is the best one.

One way to do this is by creating a Confusion Matrix for each method

And we compare the Random Forest to K-Nearest Neighbors.

We would choose the Random forest over K-Nearest Neighbors. because it predicts much better.

Now we have to do the exact same thing for Random Forest and Logistic. But in this case, it is really hard to figure out which one is better.
