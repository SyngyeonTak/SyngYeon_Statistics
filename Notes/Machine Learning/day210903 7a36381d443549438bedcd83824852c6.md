### What is Machine Learning and why are we using it?

In our daily lives, let's take a example that all people can relate. The algorithm behind Facebook' News feed make it personalized. It exploits user's data and feedback.

What is machine learning exactly?

"Machine learning is the science of getting computers to realize a task without being explicitly programmed"

Machine learning algorithms are given general guidelines that define the model, along with data. This data should contain the missing information necessary for the model to complete the task. So, a machine learning algorithm can accomplish its task when the model has been adjusted with respect to the data. We say that we "fit the model on the data" or that "the model has to be trained on the data"

Let’s illustrate this with a simple example. Let’s say we want to predict the price of a house based on the size of the house, the size of its garden, and the number of rooms it has.

We could build a machine learning algorithm. First, such algorithm would define a model that can be an incomplete formula created from our limited knowledge. Then, the model would be adjusted by training on given housing prices examples. Doing so, we combine a model with some data.

### Supervised and unsupervised models

**Supervised learning**

We want to get a model to predict the label of data based on their features. In order to learn mapping between features and labels, the model has to be fitted on given examples of features with their related labels. We say that "the model is trained on a labeled dataset"

Predicted labels can be numbers or categories. For example, we could be building a model that predicts the price of a house, implying we would want to predict a label that’s a number. In this case, we would talk about a regression model. Otherwise, we might also want to define a model that predicts a category, like “cat” or “not cat”, based on given features. In this situation, we would talk about a classification model.

**Unsupervised learning**

In unsupervised learning, we want to define a model that reveals structures in some data that are described only by their features but with no labels.

For example, unsupervised learning algorithms can help answer questions like “are there groups among my data?” or “is there any way to simplify the description of my data?”.

The model can look for different kind of underlying structures in the data. If it tries to find groups among the data we would talk about a clustering model. An example of a clustering model would be a model that segments customers of a company based on their profiles. Otherwise, if we have a model that transforms data and represents them with a smaller number of features, we would talk about a dimension reduction model. An example of this would be a model that summarises the multiple technical characteristics of some cars into a few main indicators.

**feature in statistics**

In machine learning and pattern recognition, a feature is an individual measurable property or characteristic of a phenomenon. ... The concept of "feature" is related to that of explanatory variable used in statistical techniques such as linear regression.
