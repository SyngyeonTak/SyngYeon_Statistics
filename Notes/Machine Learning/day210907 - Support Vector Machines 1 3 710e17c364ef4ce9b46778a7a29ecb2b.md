    This observation has more mass than the threshold, we classify it as obese

    But that doesn't make sense, because It is much closer to the observations that are not obese

    â†’ This threshold is pretty lame.

    ### How can we get a better threshold??

    and use the midpoint between them as the threshold

    **Terminology alert**

    Margin : The shortest distance between the observations and the threshold

    Maximal Margin Classifier:  When we use the threshold that gives us the largest margin to make classifications

    Soft margin : When we allow misclassification, the distance between the observations and the threshold is called a Soft Margin

    **How do we know the Soft Margin?**

    The answer is simple: We use Cross-Validation to determine how many misclassification and observations to allow inside of the Soft Margin to get the best classification.

    **Terminology**

    Soft Margin Classifier(Support Vector Classifier): When we use a Soft Margin to determine the location of a threshold

    The name Support Vector Classifier comes from the fact that the observations on the edge and within the Soft Margin are called Support Vectors.

    Just like before, we used Cross-Validation to determine that allowing this misclassification results in better classification in the long run

- 3 dimensional

    To make it look in 3 dimensional, we draw the dot in a different size for the depth.

    And we classify new observations by determining which side of the plane they are on

    HyperPlane: A hyperplane is a concept in geometry. It is a generalization of the plane into a different number of dimensions. A hyperplane of an n-dimensional space is a flat subset with dimension. By its nature, it separates the space into two half-spaces.
