# day211112 - Knearest neighbors

**Intro**

There are some steps for this Algorithm. the main idea is that we consider the number of observations to predict the classification for the new value.

K stands for how many observations will be considered

**Example**

There is a new value we want to classify. There are many classes of values around the new value.

 and we choose the nearest observations (K). Then we pick the class having the most values.
