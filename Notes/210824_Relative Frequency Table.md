### A few Definitions

Class: An interval in the data

Class limit: The lowest and the highest value that can fit in a class

Class width: How wide the class is

Frequency: How many values from the data fall in the class

### Relative Frequency Table

"Relative" = in relationship to the rest of the data

Frequency = f

Total sample size = n

Relative frequency = f/n

Relative frequency is the proportion of the values that are in that class

### What is a Stem a Leaf

In a stem and leaf, there is always a "stem"

Leaves are then added to the stem as we tally up the length of the leaves
