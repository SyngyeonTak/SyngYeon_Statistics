# day211011 - Tangent line

Wrong Definition: A tangent line to a curve is a line that touches the curve at only one point

Better Definition (But Wrong): A tangent line to a curve is a line that just touches the curve at only one point

â†’ it captures an idea that the line gradually approaches the curve and touches at only  one point

Better Definition (But Still wrong): A tangent line to a curve is a line that, **up close**, just touches the curve at only one point in a way that if you rotate the line even slightly, it will become a secant line and cross the curve at a second, nearby point...

It would be time-consuming to find the fitting definition...

So let's use calculus, precisely using a Limit

You can define the tangent line to A as the limit of the secant lines as P approaches 2, negative 3

1. The tangent line must touch the curve
2. Limit from the left = Limit from the right (ruling out a flatten graph)
3. Tangent Line = Best approximation by a line (Tangent line become from one another)

Derivative = Slope of Tangent Line

Alternative Definition for Tangent Line (Using Derivative)

The tangent line through a point A is the line that passes through A and whose slope is the derivative at A
