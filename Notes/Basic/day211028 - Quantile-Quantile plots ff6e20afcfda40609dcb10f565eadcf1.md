**Intro**

Let's say we have a data set. And we want to know if the data set is normally distributed

Q-Q plot will help answer that question

**Get it on**

We divide the data set into the equal size of the group of data

And we get a curve graph and get the same number of lines for the equal probability

Now we see how well the dots fit a straight line.

if the data were normally distributed, most of the points would be on the line
