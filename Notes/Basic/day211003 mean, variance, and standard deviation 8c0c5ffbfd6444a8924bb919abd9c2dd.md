mean, variance, and standard deviation

**Intro**

We could get a histogram for statistics. But if you want to fit that into a normal curve, you need to calculate the population mean and the population variance, or population standard deviation.

    population Variance
    
    population standard deviation
    
    **Note**
    
    Why do we have to square the value for variance instead of using absolute value??
    
    → ??
    
    Why do we need standard deviation from variance??
    
    → The value of variance is usually too big since it has been squared. and the values on the x-axis are not squared, we have to take the square root of variance.

**Summary**

If we have all of the data from a population, we can **calculate** the population mean.

When we don't have the population data, we can **estimate** the population mean with the same formula

**Q & A**

What is the population variance?

the average of the squared differences between population mean and the data

Why do we use square these differences?

To prevent the data on the left side from canceling the one on the right side.
