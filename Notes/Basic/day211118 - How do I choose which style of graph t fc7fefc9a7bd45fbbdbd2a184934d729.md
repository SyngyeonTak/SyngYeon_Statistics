**You would use:**

- **Bar graphs** to show numbers that are independent of each other. Example data might include things like the number of people who preferred each of Chinese takeaways, Indian takeaways and fish and chips.
- **Pie charts** to show you how a whole is divided into different parts. You might, for example, want to show how a budget had been spent on different items in a particular year.
- **Line graphs** show you how numbers have changed over time. They are used when you have data that are connected, and to show trends, for example, average night-time temperature in each month of the year.
- **Cartesian graphs** have numbers on both axes, which therefore allow you to show how changes in one thing affect another. These are widely used in mathematics, and particularly in **[algebra](https://www.skillsyouneed.com/num/algebra-introduction.html)**.
