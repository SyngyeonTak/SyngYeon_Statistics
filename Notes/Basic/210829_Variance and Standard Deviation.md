### Measures of Variation

How much does the data vary?

Imagine two different classes with the same mean grade

Can we tell how consistent each class was internally in terms of grades from a measure of central tendency?

### Range

The Range is not very useful for looking at variation because it just relies on two points

It's not stable or resistant.

Therefore, other measures are used to look at variation typically.

### Variance & statndard Deviation

How much the data vary.

Think: how well does the mean represent the spread of the data?

Standard deviation

Standard - following a standard = 'mean'

deviation - like a deviated septum

**Formulas for Variance & Standard Deviation**

The formulas for sample variance and sample standard deviation are different than those for population variance and population standard deviation

- We don't use the population ones that often
- We will concentrate on how to use the sample ones

Two different ways of doing the formula (for both sample and for population) - the "defining formula" and the "computational formula"

Both get the same results

I dislike the computational formual because I get really confused

Therefor, I will use the "defining formula"

### Why Do we Use Square for the variance?

In my opinion

If we want to see how much the dataset vary, we could consider the distance between each value and mean value. But in this case we will get both negative and positive values which will sum up to zero. If we square the each distance, we will only get the positive number. The bigger the number is, the more distant the graph is.
