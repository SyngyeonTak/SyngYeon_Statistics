### Central Tendency

In statistics, a central tendency is a central or typical value for a probability distribution. It may also be called a center or location of the distribution. Colloquially, measures of central tendency are often called averages. The term central tendency dates from the late 1920s.

### Mode

The value that occurs most frequently in the dataset in the mode

It is possible to have no mode

It is possible to have more than one mode.

**What does the mode tell you?**

not much

The most common result

### Median

Median is the Center of the Data

Every set of quantitative data can be sorted in order of lowest to highest

Sometimes there are repeats in the data

Sometimes there are outliers

Sometimes all the data values are almost the same

Even so, they can be arranged in order

The "median" is the number that is halfway

### What does the median tell you?

The 50th percentile of the data

The middle rank of the data

The median doesn't care much about the ends of the data. Outliers don't bother it.

It is resistant. It is stable

### Notation about means

**Sample Statistics**

If your mean comes from a sample, it is called x-bar.

Use a lowercase n for sample size

**Population Parameters**

If your mean comes from a population, it is called mu

Use an uppercase N for population size

### Means vs. Medians

Medians

Very resistant to ourliers, very stable

Means

Not resistant to outliers

Not very stable

### Trimming the Mean

A very high value or very low value (outliers) can really throw off the mean

This is not a problem with the median

One solution to make the mean more resistant is to "trim" data off each end so the outliers get cut off

If you trim, you have to be fair and trim the same amount off each side

### Weighted Average

Sometimes, certain values sholud count more toward the mean than others

If homework is 10% of your grade, and quizzes are 20% of your grade, the quizzes count for more than the homeword

You can arrange this by doing a weighted mean.
