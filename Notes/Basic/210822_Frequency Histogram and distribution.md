## Frequency Histogram and distribution
</br>

### What is a Frequency Histogram?

It's a specific type of bar chart made from data in a frequency table

The purpose of the chart is to identify the distribution of the data
</br>

### Relative Frequency Histogram

The proportion of your sample in each class

In the relative frequency histogram, the relative frequency goes on the y-axis

The chart looks takes on a similar pattern

Relative frequency is better for comparing two population

Why do you use Relative Frequency instead of frequency?

When you compare other populations that have more individuals, you might as well make a comparison in proportion.

### Understanding Distributions

Define distribution and why it is important to know the distribution

Describe outliers and how they can be found using histograms

Example cumulative frequency and ogives

</br>
### 5 Main types of Distributions

1. Normal distribution (also called mount-shaped symmetrical)
2. Uniform distribution
3. Skewed left distribution
4. Skewed right distribution
5. Bimodal distribution

</br>
### Outliers

Outliers are data values that are "very different" from other measurements in the dataset.
</br>

### Cumulative Frequency

In "cumulative frequency", you add up all the classes before the class you are on.

The first class is always the same as the frequency

Each cumulative frequency is equal to or higher than the last one
</br>

### Ogive

In statistics, an ogive, also known as a cumulative frequency polygon, can refer to one of two things: any hand drawn graphic of a cumulative distribution function any empirical cumulative distribution

Chart of Cumulative Frequency: Ogive

Classes along the x axis, and cumulative frequency along the y-axis

Because cumulative frequency goes up from class to class, the ogive line always goes up to the top  frequency
