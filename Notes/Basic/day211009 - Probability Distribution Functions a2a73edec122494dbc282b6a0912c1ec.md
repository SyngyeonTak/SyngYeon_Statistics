**What does 'Discrete' mean?**

Something separable.

Think of rolling a dice. You get 1 ~ 6, but you can't get 1.5, 2.5...

Now we are looking into a continuous graph. How will you get the probability for a specific value of Height? Since We can't get the probability for the exact value of height, we need to think of the area around the value. That is how the probability density comes in. The equation on the left side below is cumulative probability. To calculate the area of a specific value, we need to know calculus

The probability density on the right side shows that the maximum gradient is at 0.04 (which is the mean on x-axis).

Probability density → Cumulative probability gives the gradient

Probability density ← Cumulative probability gives the area
