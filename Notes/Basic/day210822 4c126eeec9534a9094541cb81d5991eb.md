## Randomization

### Why Randomize?

Randomization is used to assign individuals to treatment groups.

This helps prevent bias in selecting members for each group

It distributes "lurking variables" evenly

### The process for randomization

Recruit Sample → Measure Confounders and Outcome → Randomize 

→ Group A Treatment, Group B Placebo

Placebo & Placebo effect

Placebo effect occurs when there is no treatment, but participant assumes she/he is receiving treatment and responds favorably.

The placebo is given to a control group, which receives the placebo(or attention control if treatment is not a drug)

Used as control or comparison

### Blocked Randomization

If you want men and women equal in two randomized groups, create "blocks" with two slots - on for a man, and one for a [woman. As](http://woman.As) people come in and enroll in the study and you measure them, assign them to blocks.

Then, randomize the blocks. You will get a paired couples in each group!

### Blinding

Blinding is where a person (participant, research staff) is deliberately not told of a treatment assignment in a study so she/he is not biased in reporting study information

A participant is blinded to treatment or placebo.

A study radiologist may be blinded to the treatment group when looking at images during study procedures

Double-blind means study staff and participants do not know treatment assignment.
