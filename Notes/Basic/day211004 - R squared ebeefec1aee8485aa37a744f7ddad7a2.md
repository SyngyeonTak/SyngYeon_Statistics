There is 81% less variation around the line that the mean

â†’ The size/weight relationship accounts for 81% of the variation

**Why should we care about R squared?**

Interpretation is easier:

it's not obvious that R = 0.7 is twice as good as R = 0.5

However, R squared = 0.7 is what it looks like, 1.4 times as good as R squared = 0.5

It is intuitive

**What about plain old R? How is it related to R squared?**

Now, when someone says...

"The statistically significant R was 0.9..."

You can think to yourself...

"0.9 times 0.9 = 0.81. Very Good" The relationship between the two variables explains 81% of the variation in the data!
