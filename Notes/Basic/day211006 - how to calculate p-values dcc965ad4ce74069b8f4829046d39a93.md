# day211006 - how to calculate p-values

There are two types of p-values...

**How to calculate p-values**

p-values are determined by adding up probabilities, so let's start by figuring out the probability of getting 2 heads in a row

**probability:**

We have to toss the coins several times, and see how many times it occurs to get 2 heads in a row.

The equation would be **The number of times we got 2 heads / The total number of outcomes**

**A p-value is composed of...**

1) The probability random chance would result in the observation

2) The probability of observing something else that is equally rare

3) The probability of observing something rarer or more extreme

**Question**

When we get p-values for distribution, what is the main purpose of getting p-value???

What does it mean when you could reject the null hypothesis by other distributions can tell better for the specific number???(this question doesn't even make sense)

**One-sided**

**Two-sided**
