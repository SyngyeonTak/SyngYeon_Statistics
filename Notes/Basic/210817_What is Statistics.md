### Describing vs Inferring

Descriptive statistics involve methods of organizing, picturing, and summarizing information from samples and populations

Inferential statistics involves methods of using information from a sample to draw conclusions regarding the population
</br></br>



### Quantitative vs Qualitative data

Quantitative is a numerical measurement of something (continuous)

1. Interval - differences between data values are meaningful

    There is no True zero (it starts anywhere, it ends anywhere)

    example: temperature (in Celsius or Fahrenheit), mark grading, IQ test

2. Ratio - differences between data values are meaningful

    There is a True zero (has a clear definition of 0.0)

    example: heights ( 0 height means nothing).
</br></br>

Qualitative refers to a "quality" or categorical characteristic of something (Categorical)

1. Nominal - Nominal applies to categories, labels or names, and cannot be ordered from smallest to largest

    example: country, gender, race, hair color etc

2. Ordinal - Ordinal applies to data that can be arranged in order in categories

    but the difference between data values cannot be determined or is meaningless

    ordinal data includes having a position in class as “First” or “Second”.

    examples: socio economic status (“low income”,”middle income”,”high income”), education level  (“high school”,”BS”,”MS”,”PhD”)
