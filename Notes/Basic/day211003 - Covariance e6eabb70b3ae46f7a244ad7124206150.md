**Intro**

Do the measurements, taken as pairs, tell us something that the individual measurements do not?

Covariance is one way to try to answer this question

Since the measurements came from the same cells, we can plot each pair as a single dot by combing the values on the x and y-axes.

- **Covariance**
    
    The main idea behind Covariance is that it can classify three types of relationships
    
    1) Relationships with positive trends
    
    2) Relationships with negative trends
    
    3) Times when there is no relationship because there is no trend
    
    You won't ever calculate covariance and be done for the day
    
    Instead, covariance is a computational stepping stone to something that is interesting, like **correlation**
    
    Covariance
    
    It is hard to interpret covariance
    
    → it doesn't represent whether the slope for covariance is slope or not
    
    → Also, it doesn't show how close the dots on the graph are to the line
    
    → The sensitivity to scale also prevent the covariance value from telling us if the data are close to the dotted line that represents the relationship
    
    **Going on a correlation**
    
    Now we do have a motivation for correlation.
    
    Because correlation represents the relationships between two datasets and is not sensitive to the scale of the data
