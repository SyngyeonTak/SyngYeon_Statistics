### Basic Guidelines for Planning a Statistical Study

1. State a hypothesis
2. Identify the individuals of interest
3. Specify the variables to measure
4. Determine if you will use the entire population or a sample
5. Address ethical concerns before data collection
6. Collect the data
7. Use descriptive or inferential statistics to answer your hypothesis
8. Note any concerns about your data collection or analysis

### Experiment vs. Observational Study

**Experiment**

A treatment of intervention is deliberately assigned to the individuals

The purpose is to study the possible effect of the treatment or intervention on the variables measured
</br>

**Observational Study**

Observations and measurements of individuals are taken

However, no treatment or intervention is assigned by the researcher


</br></br>

### Replication

Studies must be done rigorously enough to be replicated.

Replicating the results of observational studies and experiments is necessary for science to progress
</br></br>

### Bias

Surveys can provide a lot of useful information

However, it is important that all aspects of survey design and administration minimize "bias"

Several considerations should be made
</br></br>

### Non-response & Voluntary Response

If many people refuse your survey, the people who do complete it are likely to have a biased opinion. There may be a reason they do not complete your survey that has to do with how they feel about your survey topic
</br></br>

### Hidden bias

Question-wording may induce a certain response

Order of questions and other wording may induce a certain response

Scales of questions may not accurately measure responses

Do your feelings always fit on a scale of 1 to 5?
</br></br>

### Interviewer Influence

This is important with in-person and phone surveys

Best to have an interviewer from the same population as a research participant

All verbal and non-verbal influences matter
</br></br>

### Lurking Variable

"Lurk" means to sneak around behind the scenes

A "lurking variable" is a variable that is associated with a condition but may not cause that condition.

For example, we know that having more education increases income. However, people of the same education level do not all make the same income.

Lurking variables are sex and race. In the US, according to the Department of Labor, these variables can decrease a person's income at the same level of education.
