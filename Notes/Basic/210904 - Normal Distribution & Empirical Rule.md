## Normal Distribution & Empirical Rule

### Normal Distribution

1. The curve is bell-shaped, with the highest point over the mean.
2. The curve is symmetrical around a vertical line through the mean
3. The curve approaches the horizontal axis but never touches or crosses it.
4. The inflection (transition) points between cupping upward and downward occur at about mean +/- 1 sd
5. The area under the entire curve is 1 (think: 100%)

### Empirical Rule

**Chebyshev vs. Empirical Rule**

Chebyshev's Theorem

1. Applies to any distribution
2. Says "at least"
    - between Mu +/- 2 * sd, there are at least 75% of the data
    - between Mu +/- 3 * sd, there are at least 88.9% of the data
    - between Mu +/- 4 * sd, there are at least 93.8% of the data

Empirical Rule

1. Applies to only the normal distribution
2. Says "approximately"
    - 68% of the data are in interval Mu +/- 1 * sd
    - 95% in interval Mu +/- 2 * sd
    - 99.7% (almost all) in interval Mu +/- 3 *sd
