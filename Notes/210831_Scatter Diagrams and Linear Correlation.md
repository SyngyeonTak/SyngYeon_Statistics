## Scatter Diagrams and Linear Correlation

### Scattergram Graph x, y Pairs

Independent Variable: Variables x 

dependent Variable: Variables y

 

### Linear Correlation

Linear correlation means that when you make a scatter plot of x, y pairs, it looks kind of like a line

"Perfect" linear correlation looks like graphong points in algebra

### Facts About Linear correlation

The line can go up. This is a positive correlation

The line can go down. This is a negative correlation

If the line is straight or goofy, there is no corrlation.

### Correlation Has Two Attributes

**Strength**

Strength refers to how close to the line all the dots fall

If they fall really close to the line, it is strong

If they fall kind of close to the line, it is moderate

If they aren't very close to the line, it is weak

### Outliers in Correlation

Outliers can have a very powerful effect on a correlation

An outlier in any of the 4 corners of the plot can really affect the direction of the line

An outlier can also change the correlation from strong and moderate to weak

It's good to look at a scatterplot to make sure you identify outliers

### Correlaion Coefficient r

### What is r

A numerical quantification of how correlated a set of x, y pairs are

Calculated from plugging x, y pairs into an equation

Has a defining formula and a computational formula

### How to interpret it

The r calculation produces a number

The lowest number possible is -1.0 → perfect negative correlation

The highest number possible is 1.0 → perfect positive correlation

All others are in-between
